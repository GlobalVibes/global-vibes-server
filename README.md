# Global Vibes 

## Overview

This is a web application project developed as the final assignment for a web development bootcamp. The project is a social media platform where users can share pictures related to specific hobbies. Users can choose from a predefined list of hobbies or add their own to the database, create posts, and interact with other users' posts. The project is divided into a frontend built with React and a backend built with ExpressJS, MongoDB, and Mongoose.

## Technical Requirements

The application meets the following technical requirements:

- **Frontend**: The frontend is a Single Page Application (SPA) built with React. It consists of multiple views and implements all CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) actions.

- **Backend**: The backend is implemented using ExpressJS, MongoDB, and Mongoose. It provides a REST API that the React app communicates with. The API includes routes for all CRUD actions for the post model and Create / Read for User and Hobby models.

- **Database Models**: The application has three database models. 

- **Authentication**: The app includes user authentication, allowing users to sign up, log in, and log out. Passwords are encrypted for security. Authorization is implemented, ensuring that logged-in users have additional privileges.

- **GitHub Repositories**: The project is organized into two separate GitHub repositories - one for the frontend React application and another for the backend REST API.

- **Validation and Error Handling**: The backend includes validation and centralized error handling for the REST API.

- **Deployment**: The app is deployed online, making it accessible to anyone. 


## Project Structure

The project consists of two main parts:

1. **Frontend** (Repository: [Link to Frontend Repo](https://github.com/GlobalVibes/global-vibes-client)): The frontend is built with React and provides the user interface for interacting with the platform. It communicates with the backend API to perform CRUD operations.

2. **Backend** (Repository: [Link to Backend Repo](https://github.com/GlobalVibes/global-vibes-server)): The backend is built with ExpressJS and uses MongoDB with Mongoose for data storage. It handles authentication, CRUD operations, and error handling.
